>> RIPLEY
How long have I been on Gateway station
>> MED TECH
Just a couple of days Do you feel up to a visitor
>> RIPLEY
Jones
>> MAN
Nice room Im Burke Carter Burke I work for the company but other than that Im an okay guy Glad to see youre feeling better Im told the weakness and disorientation should pass soon Side effects of the unusually long hypersleep or something like that
>> RIPLEY
How long was I out there They wont tell me anything
>> RIPLEY
How long
>> BURKE
All right My instinct says youre strong enough to handle this Fifty seven years
>> RIPLEY
Fifty seven oh Christ
>> BURKE
Youd drifted right through the core systems Its blind luck that deep salvage team caught you when they are you all right
>> RIPLEY
No noooo
>> DOCTOR
Hold her Get me an airway stat And fifteen ccs of Jesus
>> MED TECH
Bad dreams again Do you want something to help you sleep
>> RIPLEY
We made it Jones We made it
>> BURKE
Sorry Ive been running behind all morning
>> RIPLEY
Have they located my daughter yet
>> BURKE
Well I was going to wait until after the inquest
>> RIPLEY
Is she
>> RIPLEY
Amy
>> RIPLEY
I promised her Id be home for her birthday Her eleventh birthday I sure missed that one Well she has already learned to take my promises with a grain of salt When it came to flight schedules anyway
>> RIPLEY
You always think you can make it up to somebody later you know But now I never can I never can
>> RIPLEY
You read my deposition its complete and accurate
>> BURKE
Look I believe you but there are going to be some heavyweights in there You got Feds you got interstellar commerce commission you got colonial administration insurance company guys
>> RIPLEY
I get the picture
>> BURKE
Just tell them what happened The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional
>> RIPLEY
Do you people have earwax of what We have been here three hours How many different ways do you want me to tell the same story
>> VAN LEUWEN
Look at it from our perspective You freely admit to detonating the engines of and thereby destroying an M Class star freighter A rather expensive piece of hardware
>> VAN LEUWEN
The shuttles flight recorder corroborates some elements of your account That the Nostromo set down on LV 426 an unsurveyed planet at that time That repairs were made That it resumed its course and was subsequently set for self destruct By you For reasons unknown
>> RIPLEY
Look I told you
>> VAN LEUWEN
It did not however contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up
>> RIPLEY
Then somebodys gotten to it doctored the recorder Who had access to it
>> ECA REP
Would you just listen to yourself for one minute
>> VAN LEUWEN
The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe
>> ECA REP
No Its a rock No indigenous life larger than a simple virus
>> RIPLEY
I told you it wasnt indigenous There was an alien spacecraft there A derelict ship We homed on its beacon
>> ECA REP
To be perfectly frank weve surveyed over three hundred worlds and no ones ever reported a creature which using your words gestates in a living human host and has concentrated molecular acid for blood
>> RIPLEY
Look I can see where this is going But Im telling you those things exist Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs Thousands Do you understand I suggest you find it using the flight recorders data Find it and deal with it before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise
>> VAN LEUWEN
Thank you Officer Ripley That will be
>> VAN LEUWEN
Thank you that will be all
>> RIPLEY
Thats not all Goddamnit If those things get back here that will be all Then you can just kiss it good bye Jack Just kiss it goodbye
>> BURKE
You had them eating out of your hand kiddo
>> RIPLEY
They had their minds made up before I even went in there They think Im a head case
>> VAN LEUWEN
It is the finding of this board of inquiry that Warrent Officer Ellen Ripley NOC 14672 has acted with questionable judgment and is unfit to hold an ICC license as a commercial flight officer
>> VAN LEUWEN
Said license is hereby suspended indefinitely No criminal charges will be filed at this time and you are released on own recognizance for a six month period of psychometric probation to include monthly review by an ICC psychiatric tech
>> RIPLEY
What are you talking about What people
>> VAN LEUWEN

>> SIMPSON
Christ Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere we look They dont say why and I dont ask I dont ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answers always dont ask

>> RIPLEY
Thats not what I mean Gorman if your men have to use their weapons in there theyll rupture the cooling system
>> GORMAN

>> SPUNKMEYER

>> VASQUEZ
All right we cant blow the fuck out of them why not roll some canisters of CN 20 down there Nerve gas the whole nest
>> HUDSON
Look man lets just bug out and call it even okay
>> BURKE
Now hold on a second Im not authorizing that action
>> RIPLEY
Why not
>> BURKE
Well I mean I know this is an emotional moment but lets not make snap judgments Lets move cautiously First this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it
>> RIPLEY
They can bill me I got a tab running Whats second
>> BURKE
This is clearly an important species were dealing with here We cant just arbitrarily exterminate them
>> RIPLEY
Bullshit
>> VASQUEZ
Yeah bullshit Watch us
>> HUDSON
Maybe you havent been keeping up on current events but we just got out asses kicked pal
>> RIPLEY
Look Burke We had an agreement
>> BURKE
I know I know but were dealing with changing scenarios here This thing is major Ripley I mean really major You gotta go with its energy Since you are the representative of the company who discovered this species your percentage will naturally be some serious serious money
>> RIPLEY
You son of a bitch
>> RIPLEY
What rank I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here
>> BURKE
Corporal Hicks
>> RIPLEY
This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command Right
>> HICKS
Looks that way
>> BURKE
Look this is a multimillion dollar operation He cant make that kind of decision Hes just a grunt No offense
>> HICKS
Prep for dust off Were gonna need an immediate evac I think well take off and nuke the site from orbit Its the only way to be sure
>> BURKE
This is absurd You dont have the authority to
>> RIPLEY
Were going home honey
>> FERRO
Spunkmeyer Goddammit
>> RIPLEY
Run
>> HICKS
Are you finished You okay
>> NEWT
I guess were not leaving right
>> RIPLEY
Im sorry Newt
>> NEWT
You dont have to be sorry It wasnt your fault
>> NEWT
We should get back cause itll be dark soon They come mostly at night Mostly
>> HICKS
This is all we could salvage Weve got four pulse rifles with about fifty rounds each Not so good About fifteen M 40 grenades and two flame throwers less than half full one damaged And Weve got four of these robot sentry units with scanners and display intact
>> RIPLEY
How long after were declared overdue can we expect a rescue
>> HICKS
About seventeen days
>> HUDSON
Man were not going to make it seventeen hours Those things are going to come in here just like they did before man theyre going to come in here and get us man long before
>> RIPLEY
She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training
>> RIPLEY
So you better just start dealing with it Just deal with it Hudson because we need you and Im tired of your bullshit Now get on a terminal and call up some kind of floor plan file Construction blueprints maintenance schematics anything that shows the layout of this place I want to see air ducts electrical access tunnels subbasements Every possible way into this wing
>> HUDSON
Aye firmative Im on it
>> BISHOP
Ill be in medical Id like to continue my analysis
>> RIPLEY
Fine You do that
>> RIPLEY
This service tunnel is how theyre moving back and forth
>> HUDSON
Yeah right it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here
>> RIPLEY
All right Theres a fire door at this end The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door
>> HICKS
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex
>> RIPLEY
Thats right So we put up welded barricades at these intersections and seal these ducts here and here Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units here
>> HICKS
Outstanding Then all we needs a deck of cards All right lets move like we got a purpose
>> HUDSON
Aye firmative
>> HUDSON
Hudson here A and B sentries are in place and keyed Were sealing the tunnel
>> HICKS
Here put this on Then I can locate you anywhere in the complex on this
>> HICKS
Just a precaution You know
>> HUDSON
Uh whats next
>> RIPLEY
Now you just lie here and have a nap Youre exhausted
>> NEWT
I dont want to I have scary dreams
>> RIPLEY
Ill bet Casey doesnt have bad dreams
>> RIPLEY
Nothing bad in here Maybe you could just try to be like her
>> NEWT
Ripley she doesnt have bad dreams because shes just a piece of plastic
>> RIPLEY
Oh Sorry Newt
>> NEWT
My mommy always said there were no monsters No real ones But there are
>> NEWT
Why do they tell little kids that
>> RIPLEY
Well some kids cant handle it like you can
>> NEWT
Did one of those things grow inside her
>> RIPLEY
I dont know Newt Thats the truth
>> NEWT
Isnt that how babies come I mean people babies they grow inside you
>> RIPLEY
No its different honey
>> NEWT
Did you ever have a baby
>> RIPLEY
Yes A little girl
>> NEWT
Where is she
>> NEWT
You mean dead
>> NEWT
Ripley I was just thinking Maybe I could do you a favor and fill in for her Just for a while You can try it and if you dont like it its okay Ill understand No big deal Whattya think
>> RIPLEY
I think its not the worst idea Ive heard all day Lets talk about it later
>> NEWT
Dont go Please
>> RIPLEY
Ill be right in the other room Newt And look I can see you on that camera right up there
>> RIPLEY
Here Take is for luck Now go to sleep and dont dream
>> BISHOP
Ive isolated a neuro muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis It seems to be metabolizing He should wake up soon
>> RIPLEY
Now let me get this straight The aliens paralyzed the colonists carried them over there cocooned them to be hosts for more of those
>> RIPLEY
Which would mean lots of those parasites right One for each person over a hundred at least
>> BISHOP
Yes That follows
>> RIPLEY
But these things come from eggs so where are all the eggs coming from
>> BISHOP
That is the question of the hour We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization An ant of termite colony for example is ruled by a single female a queen which is the source of new eggs
>> RIPLEY
Youre saying one of those things lays all the eggs
>> BISHOP
Well the queen is always physically larger then the others A termite queens abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it cant move at all It is fed and tended by drone workers defended by the warriors She is the center of their lives quite literally the mother of their society
>> RIPLEY
Could it be intelligent
>> BISHOP
Hard to say It may have been blind instinct attraction to the heat of whatever but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldnt destroy her without destroying ourselves Thats if she exists of course
>> BISHOP
Mr Burke have instructions that they were to be kept alive in stasis for return to the company labs He was very specific
>> RIPLEY
Burke
>> BURKE
Those specimens are worth millions to the bio weapons division Now if youre smart we can both come out of this heroes Set up for life
>> RIPLEY
You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine Section 22350 of the Commerce Code
>> BURKE
Youve been doing your homework Look they cant impound it if they dont know about it
>> RIPLEY
But they will know about it Burke From me Just like theyll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty seven colonists here
>> BURKE
Now wait a second
>> RIPLEY
You sent them out there and you didnt even warn them Burke Why didnt you warn them
>> BURKE
Look maybe the thing didnt even exist right And if Id made it a major security situation the Administration wouldve stepped in Then no exclusive rights nothing
>> BURKE
It was a bad call thats all
>> RIPLEY
Bad call These people are fucking dead Burke Well theyre going to nail your hide to the shed and Ill be there when they do
>> RIPLEY
Sorry to disappoint you
>> HICKS
Theyre coming Theyre in the tunnel
>> HICKS
Guns A and B Tracking and firing on multiple targets
>> HUDSON
They must be wall to wall in there Look at those ammo counters go Its a shooting gallery down there
>> HICKS
B guns dry Twenty on A Ten Five Thats it
>> RIPLEY
Theyre at the fire door
>> HUDSON
Man listen to that
>> HUDSON
Well thats a switch
>> BISHOP
Thats it See it Emergency venting
>> RIPLEY
How long until it blows
>> BISHOP
Im projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours The blast radius will be about thirty kilometers About equal to ten megatons
>> HICKS
We got problems
>> HUDSON
I dont fucking believe this Do you believe this
>> RIPLEY
And its too late to shut it down
>> BISHOP
Im afraid so The crash did too much damage The overload is inevitable at this point
>> HUDSON
Oh man And I was gettin short too Four more weeks and out Now Im gonna buy it on this fuckin rock It aint half fair man
>> VASQUEZ
Hudson give us a break
>> HUDSON
How The transmitter was on the APC Its wasted
>> HUDSON
Think of what Were fucked
>> RIPLEY
What about the colony transmitter That up link tower down at the other end Why cant we use that
>> BISHOP
I checked The hard wiring between here and there was severed in the fighting
>> RIPLEY
Well then somebodys just going to have to go out there Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually
>> HUDSON
Oh right Right With those things running around No way
>> RIPLEY
What
>> BISHOP
Im really the only one qualified to remote pilot the ship anyway Believe me Id prefer not to I may be synthetic but Im not stupid
>> RIPLEY
All right Lets get on it Whatll you need
>> VASQUEZ
Listen Its stopped
>> HICKS
Well theyre into the complex
>> BISHOP
This duct runs almost to the up link assembly One hundred eighty meters Say forty minutes to crawl down there One hour to patch in and align the antenna Thirty minutes to prep the ship then about fifty minutes flight time
>> RIPLEY
Its going to be closer You better get going
>> HICKS
Twenty meters and closing Fifteen C and D guns down about fifty percent
>> RIPLEY
Now many
>> HICKS
Cant tell Lots D guns down to twenty Ten Its out
>> RIPLEY
They retreated The guns stopped them
>> HICKS
Yeah But look
>> HICKS
Newt time then can walk right up and knock
>> RIPLEY
But they dont know that Theyre probably looking for other ways to get in Thatll take them awhile
>> HUDSON
Maybe we got em demoralized
>> HICKS
How long since you slept Twenty four hours
>> HICKS
Maybe Maybe not
>> RIPLEY
Hicks Im not going to wind up like those others Youll take care of it wont you it if comes to that
>> HICKS
If it comes to that Ill do us both Lets see that it doesnt Here Id like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine
>> HICKS
M 41A 10mm pulse rifle over and under with a 30mm pump action grenade launcher
>> RIPLEY
What do I do
>> HICKS
Just pull it in real right It will kick some When the counter here heads zero hit this
>> HICKS
Just let it drop right out Get the other one in quick Just slap it in hard it likes abuse Now pull the bolt
>> HICKS
Youre ready again
