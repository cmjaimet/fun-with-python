# Fun With Python
Some assorted scripts in Python. Some of these are just stubs - incomplete snippets I've used to work out bigger problems, and fun mini-challenges. If they're of any use to you please go ahead and download them.

## Fizzbuzz: the "Hello world!" of algorithms

The goal of FizzBuzz is to write a short bit of code that displays a set of numbered lines (1-20 say).
On each line that is evenly divisible by 3, print "Fizz".
On each line that is evenly divisible by 5, print "Buzz".
On each line that is evenly divisible by both, print "FizzBuzz".
It's about as basic as it gets, but covers loops and conditionals neatly so it's a good first algorithm to learn on.

Just for fun. Enjoy responsibly.
