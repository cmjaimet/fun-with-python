Thor Ragnarok

>> THOR
Now I know what youre thinking Oh no Thors in a cage How did this happen Well sometimes you have to get captured just to get a straight answer out of somebody Its a long story but basically Im a bit of a hero See I spent some time on earth fought some robots saved the planet a couple of times Then I went searching through the cosmos for some magic colorful Infinity Stone things didnt find any Thats when I came across a path of death and destruction which led me all the way here into this cage where I met you
>> THOR
How much longer do you think well be here
>> SURTUR
Thor Son of Odin
>> THOR
Surtur Son of a bitch youre still alive I thought my father killed you like half a million years ago
>> SURTUR
I cannot die Not until I fulfill my destiny and lay waste to your home
>> THOR
You know its funny you should mention that because Ive been having these terrible dreams of late Asgard up in flames falling to ruins and you Surtur are at the center of all of them
>> SURTUR
Then you have seen Ragnarok the fall of Asgard The great prophecy
>> THOR
Hang on Hang on
>> THOR
Ill be back around shortly I really feel like we were connecting there
>> THOR
Okay so Ragnarok Tell me about that Walk me through it
>> SURTUR
My time has come When my crown is reunited with the Eternal Flame I shall be restored to my full might I will tower over the mountains and bury my sword deep in Asgards
>> THOR
Oh hang on Give it a second
>> THOR
I swear Im not even moving its just doing this on its own Im really sorry Okay let me get this straight Youre going to put your crown into the Eternal Flame and then youll suddenly grow as big as a house
>> SURTUR
A mountain
>> THOR
The Eternal Flame that Odin keeps locked away on Asgard
>> SURTUR
Odin is not on Asgard And your absence has left the throne defenseless
>> THOR
Okay so where is it This crown
>> SURTUR
This is my Crown the source of my power
>> THOR
Oh thats a crown I thought it was a big eyebrow
>> SURTUR
Its a crown
>> THOR
Anyway it sounds like all I have to do to stop Ragnarok is rip that thing off your head
>> SURTUR
But Ragnarok has already begun You cannot stop it I am Asgards doom and so are you All will suffer all will burn holding it so he and Thor are face to face
>> THOR
Thats intense To be honest seeing you grow really big and set fire to a planet would be quite the spectacle But it looks like Im going to have to go with option B where I bust out of these chains knock that tiara off your head and stash it away in Asgards vault
>> SURTUR
You cannot stop Ragnarok Why fight it
>> THOR
Because thats what heroes do
>> THOR
Wait sorry I didnt time that right And now flies a distance away He FLINGS Mjolnir back at Surtur smashing the giant in the face Mjolnir returns
>> SURTUR
You have made a grave mistake Odinson
>> THOR
I make grave mistakes all the time Everything seems to work out
>> THOR
Heimdall I know its been a while but I could use a fast exit
>> THOR
Heimdall
>> SKURGE
Heimdall was an idiot This job should have made him rich Now the job aint easy but it does have its benefits The Bi Frost gives me access to everything the Nine Realms have to offer I mean its all mine for the taking Behold my stuff
>> SKURGE
Im particularly fond of these I pulled em out of a place on Midgard called Texas I even named them Des and Troy You see when you put them together they destroy
>> THOR

>> THOR

>> SKURGE
That traitor No one knows hes a fugitive of the throne
>> THOR
Traitor
>> SKURGE

So its back to Midgard for you is it
>> THOR
Nope Ive been having this reocurring dream lately
>> THOR
Every night I see Asgard fall into ruins
>> ODIN
Thats just a silly dream Signs of an overactive imagination
>> THOR
Possibly but then I decide to go out there and investigate And what do I find but the Nine Realms completely in chaos Enemies of Asgard assembling plotting our demise all while you Odin the protector of those Nine Realms are sitting here in your bathrobe eating grapes
>> ODIN
Well it is best to respect our neighbors freedom

Yes besides I have been rather busy myself
>> THOR
Watching theatre
>> ODIN
Board meetings and security council meetings

>> KORG
Oh my God The hammer pulled you off
>> THOR
The ground It would pull me off the ground up into the air and I would fly Every time I threw it it would always come back to me

ASGARDIAN SWORD Thors eyes go wide as she sharpens it
>> THOR
Is that a Dragonfang
>> VALKYRIE
It is
>> THOR
My God This is the famed sword of the Valkyrie
>> VALKYRIE
Sakaar and Asgard are about as far apart as any two known systems Our best bet is a wormhole just outside the city limits
>> VALKYRIE
Refuel on Xandar and be back in Asgard in around 18 months
>> THOR
Nope Were going through that one
>> VALKYRIE
The Devils Anus
>> BANNER
Wait whose anus are we going through
>> THOR
For the record I didnt know it was called that when I picked it
>> BANNER
That looks like a collapsing neutron star inside of an Einstein Rosen Bridge
>> VALKYRIE
We need another ship That would tear mine to pieces
>> THOR
Shes right We need one that can withstand the geodetic strain from the singularity
>> BANNER
And has an offline power steering system that could also function without the on board computer
>> VALKYRIE
And we need one with cup holders because were gonna die So drinks
>> BANNER
Do I know you I feel like I know you
>> VALKYRIE
I feel like I know you too Its weird
>> BANNER THOR
We need a ship Need a ship

>> LOKI
I dont mean to impose but the Grandmaster has a great many ships I may eve have stolen the access codes to his security system smashes above his head
>> VALKYRIE
And suddenly youre overcome with an urge to do the right thing
>> LOKI
Heavens no Ive run out of favor with the Grandmaster
>> LOKI
And in exchange for codes and access to a ship Im asking for safe passage through the anus
>> THOR
Youre telling us you can get us access into the garage without setting off any alarms
>> LOKI
Yes brother I can
>> BANNER
Okay can I just A quick FYI I was just talking to him just a couple minutes ago and he was totally ready to kill any of us

>> THOR
You have no idea Ive had quite the revelation since we spoke last
>> THOR
Hello
>> LOKI
Hi
>> LOKI
Odin brought us together its almost poetic that his death should split us apart We might as well be strangers now Two sons of the crown set adrift
>> THOR
Thought you didnt want to talk about it
>> LOKI
Heres the thing Im probably better off staying here on Sakaar
>> THOR
Thats exactly what I was thinking
>> LOKI
Did you just agree with me
>> THOR
This place is perfect for you Its savage chaotic lawless Brother youre going to do GREAT here
>> LOKI
Do you truly think so little of me
>> THOR
Loki I thought the world of you I thought we were gonna fight side by side forever But at the end of the day youre you Im me
>> THOR
I dont know maybe theres still good in you but lets be honest our paths diverged a long time ago his feelings with

>> THOR
Thats what you always wanted
>> THOR

Though I feel it wont make much of a difference
>> THOR
Oh Loki
>> LOKI
I know Ive betrayed you many times before but this time its truly nothing personal The reward for your capture will set me up nicely
>> THOR
Never one for sentiment were you
>> LOKI
Easier to let it burn
>> THOR
I agree
>> THOR
Oh brother youre becoming predictable I trust you you betray me Round and round in circles we go
>> THOR
See Loki life is about its about growth Its about change But you seem to just wanna stay the same I guess what Im trying to say is that youll always be the God of Mischief but you could be more Ill just put this over here for you
>> THOR
Anyway I got places to be so good luck
>> THOR
All right I can figure this out Its just another spaceship
>> GRANDMASTER
Loyal Sakaarians Lord of Thunder has stolen my ship and my favorite champion Sakaarians take to the skies Bring him down Do not let him leave this planet

Sister
>> HELA
Youre still alive
>> THOR
I love what youve done with the place Redecorating I see
>> HELA
It seems our fathers solution to every problem was to cover it up
>> THOR
Or to cast it out He told you you were worthy He said the same thing to me
>> HELA
You see you never knew him not at his best Odin and I drowned entire civilizations in blood and tears Where do you think all this gold came from And then one day he decided to become a benevolent king
>> HELA
To foster peace to protect life To have you
>> THOR
I understand why youre angry And you are my sister and technically have a claim to the throne And believe me I would love for someone else to rule But it cant be you Youre just the worst
>> HELA
Okay get up Youre in my seat

>> LOKI
Your savior is here on THE GRANDMASTERS SUPERCRUISER For reasons that will become clear we will henceforth call this ship THE ARK from the Contest of Champions Armed with gladiator weapons The Ark slows to a stop at the middle of bridge but smile at the sight of Loki Hela however sneers
>> HELA
That little shit onto the bridge joining the fight against Helas forces
